**Contributing to Themes**

We welcome contributions to our theme repository! If you're interested in creating a new theme for our software, please follow these guidelines:

**Before You Start**

1. Read through our [Palette](palette.md) document to get an understanding of the color palette and design principles we use for our themes.
2. Choose a theme idea or inspiration from our existing themes or come up with your own unique idea.

**Theme Framework**

We use a simple CSS framework to make it easy to create themes. Here are the basic components you'll need to include:

* `body` element: set the background color using the `background-color` property.
* `header` element: set the background color using the `background-color` property.
* `nav` element: set the background color using the `background-color` property.
* `main` element: set the background color using the `background-color` property.

**Submitting Your Theme**

1. Once you've created your theme, upload it to this repository by creating a new pull request.
2. Include screenshots of your theme in action (see below).

**Screenshots**

Please include at least two screenshots of your theme:

* A screenshot of the theme's preview page (`index.html`)
* A screenshot of the theme in action, showing how it looks in our software

**Code Style**

We follow the standard code style guidelines for our project. Please make sure to format your code correctly and follow our coding conventions.

**License**

By contributing a theme to this repository, you agree to license it under the terms of our project's license (MIT).
